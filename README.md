# Recursion

The Office is my favorite show, and I recently became confused/obsessed with figuring out how recursion works! I took the characters from The Office and created my first recursion to display who works for who. This was a really fun little project that I am excited to come back to in my free time, and add the other Dunder Mifflin branches.
